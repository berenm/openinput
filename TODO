Loose ends and suggestions for improvements
-------------------------------------------

correct/shorten variable types
- device-index -> uchar
- event_type -> uchar
- x,y,width,height,deltas -> sshort
- masks -> uint
- document the types and common variables

ogre integration
- write small howto (the glxwindowinterface)
- speed optimization? poll/wait is slow?

action-binding system
- event based
- state manager

threading
- is it really needed?

joystick support
- event based
- state manager

other-wierd-kind-of-input-device-support
- tablets
- touchscreen
- 3d pointer devices

automake/autoconf issues
- src/x11/Makefile.am:11: variable `X_LIBS_EXTRA' not defined
