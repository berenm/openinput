Loose ends and suggestions for improvements
-------------------------------------------

win32 driver/platform
- does keyboard work correctly?
- is the event handling slow?
- investigate/fix existance trouble of WM_MOUSEWHEEL and
  MOUSETRACKEVENT which may/may not exist under WinXP (?)

could-be bugs
- number of concurrently pressed keys limited to 3-5 (hw?)
- no keyboard focus on fullscreen (even with grab on?)

ogre integration
- write small howto (the glxwindowinterface)
- hooking into applications on x11/win32

documentation
- manpages (doxygen'ed?)
- write custom INSTALL file (UNIX, win32, mingw, etc.)
- getting started guide
- manual and design document

threading
- is it really needed?

other-wierd-kind-of-input-device-support ("HID")
- tablets
- touchscreen
- 3d pointer devices
- see ogre forum links (seeking input on input)
- native Linux device driver

cleanups
- implement per-driver instance data pointer, which
  is passed on from the first _avail invokation
- remove any global data structures

exclusive device drivers
- allow drivers exclusive provide mode
  ie. only one joystick driver, keyboard driver, etc.

features
- oi_keysym to "unicode character" translation
