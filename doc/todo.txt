Loose ends and suggestions for improvements
-------------------------------------------

library close->reopen
- does it work?
- memory leaks

could-be bugs
- number of concurrently pressed keys limited to 3-5 (hw?)
- no keyboard focus on fullscreen (even with grab on?)

ogre integration
- write small howto (the glxwindowinterface)

correct/shorten variable types
- device-index -> uchar
- event_type -> enum
- x,y,relx,rely,width,height,deltas -> u/sshort
- masks -> uint
- document the types and common variables
- event structure members -> use correct/strict types
- manager "event injectors" should have both "post" and
  "index" passed along in order to find device structure
  even if not posting
- parameter default ordering, ie. "index" first, then "post",
  etc.

generic private data
- all devices should have both driver and state private data
- generic interface
- missing for keyboard and mouse manager

documentation
- manpages (doxygen'ed?)
- enable/disble some pages?

threading
- is it really needed?

joystick support
- events
- general state manager
- per-device state managment in manager, not driver
- full axes/button/hat/ball/throttle/rudder mapping support
- absolute/relative axes handling
- come up with a good code/string naming scheme (joy1_button2?)
- extended joystick information and user-joystick-map setup

other-wierd-kind-of-input-device-support ("HID")
- tablets
- touchscreen
- 3d pointer devices
- see ogre forum links (seeking input on input)
