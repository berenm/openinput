Loose ends and suggestions for improvements
-------------------------------------------

library close->reopen
- does it work?
- memory leaks

could-be bugs
- number of concurrently pressed keys limited to 3-5 (hw?)
- no keyboard focus on fullscreen (even with grab on?)

ogre integration
- write small howto (the glxwindowinterface)

documentation
- manpages (doxygen'ed?)

threading
- is it really needed?

joystick support
- events
- general state manager
- per-device state managment in manager, not driver
- full axes/button/hat/ball/throttle/rudder mapping support (?)
- come up with a good code/string naming scheme (joy_buttonXXX?)
- extended joystick information and user-joystick-map setup
- absolute/relative axes handling (FIX NEEDED)

other-wierd-kind-of-input-device-support ("HID")
- tablets
- touchscreen
- 3d pointer devices
- see ogre forum links (seeking input on input)
