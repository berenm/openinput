Loose ends and suggestions for improvements
-------------------------------------------

could-be bugs
- concurrently number of pressed keys limited to 3-5 (hw?)
- no keyboard on fullscreen (even with grab on?)

ogre integration
- write small howto (the glxwindowinterface)

correct/shorten variable types
- device-index -> uchar
- event_type -> enum
- x,y,width,height,deltas -> sshort
- masks -> uint
- document the types and common variables

threading
- is it really needed?

joystick support
- event based
- state manager

other-wierd-kind-of-input-device-support
- tablets
- touchscreen
- 3d pointer devices
