-- Notes on the internal API
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Ownership of event variables:

queue_add() will COPY the given event into the queue, ie.  you can
throw the memory away after the call.

queue_peep() will COPY the event into the user's pointer, ie. you
must allocate space for the event(s) before calling the functon.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Boot process:

The following describes the basic flow in the boot process.

oi_init()
	// Stage 1: Initialize the queue
	oi_running = FALSE;
	queue_init();

	// Stage 2: Bootstrap devices
	device_bootstrap()
		bootstrap->avail(); ***
		bootstrap->create(); ***
		queue_add(oi_discovery_event);

	// State 3: Initialize devices
	device_init();
		device->init(); ***

	// Stage 4: Initialize state managers
	appstate_init();
	keyboard_init();
	mouse_init();
	action_init();

	// Stage 5: Enter running state
	oi_running = TRUE;

You, as a device driver hacker, needs only implement the functions
marked by ***. All other steps are handled automatically by the
bootstrap process. Also, in order for device_bootstrap() to use your
driver, you'll need to hook into the boostrap-table - please see
the 'bootstrap.h' file for information (it's dead simple!).

Important: Do NOT dispatch events before the oi_running flag has
been set! Devices may (if multithreaded) begin to run before the
state managers have initialized. You can, however, use the queue
if you really have to (like sending discovery events).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* 'bootstrap' structure:

The bootstrap-structure provides some basic information about a device
whether or not the device is physically able to run on the given
platform. All implementations of bootstrap-structures are linked
together in the bootstrap-table, which is used in the 2nd boot stage.
See the 'bootstrap.h' file for examples. The members of the bootstrap
structure are:

char *name;
  Device short name, eg. 'x11' or 'linuxsignal'.

char *desc;
  Device long description, eg. 'X11 Window system'.

sint provides;
  A bitmask of OI_PRO_* bits that describes what the device
  provides.

sint (*avail)(unsigned int flags);
  Function pointer to the function that checks whether the device is
  present on the system (ie. can be initialized and used). The return
  result is either true (1) or false (0). The flags paramater is the
  same as delivered to device->init functions (ie. user-supplied).

oi_device *(*create)();
  Function pointer that returns the 'device' structure. This function
  is only called when the avail()-function has returned true. The
  function should ONLY setup the device-structure. Any further
  initialization should be done in the device->init() function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* 'device' structure:

The device-structure functions as the abstraction interface for all
devices whether they represent X11 keyboards, mice or Windows message
handlers. The members of the structure are used for the following:

sint index
  Device index number - should not be used.

char *name;
  Device short name. Same as the bootstrap 'name'.

char *desc;
  Device long description. Same as the bootstrap 'desc'.

uint provides;
  Provide bitmask. Same as the bootstrap 'provides'.

void *private;
  Pointer for private data. If the device needs global
  persistent data, use this pointer, as regular global variables are a
  very bad idea in order to ensure reuse of the same driver (more
  keyboards of same type).

sint (*init)(oi_device *dev, char *window_id, uint flags);
  Function pointer for the device initialization. Called by oi_init()
  in the second boot stage.

sint (*destroy)(oi_device *dev);
  Close the device. Should free any private data.

void (*process)(oi_device *dev);
  Do the event processing. This typically consists of a
  while(pending){dispatch} loop, where the dispatcher feeds events into
  the queue and/or uses the keyboard/mouse/app-state functions.

sint (*grab)(oi_device *dec, sint on);
  Grabs input and pointer focus.

sint (*hide)(oi_device *dev, sint on);
  Hides cursor.

sint (*warp)(oi_device *dev, sint x, sint y);
  Warp (move) the mouse cursor to the given coordinates.

sint (*winsize)(oi_device *dev, sint *x, sint *y);
  Function should fill 'x' and 'y' with the current window
  geometry, ie. width and height in pixels.

You will need only to implement the functions. The properties 'index',
'name', 'desc' and 'provides' gets set by the device_bootstrap()
function just after the bootstrap->device() call. The settings are,
of course, copied from the bootstrap structure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Required and optional device functions

The following functions (function pointers) MUST be implemented:
  init()
  destroy()
  process()
  
The following functions are OPTIONAL, and should be set to NULL
if they are not implemented:
  grab()
  hide()
  warp()
  winsize()

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Keyboard and mouse state managers

In order to keep the number of arguments down in the internal
state update functions, the "postdev" argument is encoded as:
0  : no event gets posted.
!0 : event gets posted with "postdev" as the sending device index.

Some functions use the 'default device', eg. when warping the
pointer and for window size/focus managment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

* General info on Action mapper

The action mapper generates abstract events (and a state-table)
based on real events. This allows the user to catch "jump" and
"fire" events instead of listening for "space down" or
"mouse wheel down".

The user is in charge of delivering the "action map" via the
oi_action_install(map, num). The memory is not used when the
call returns.

The "num" parameter contains the number of maps in the "map"
parameter. The "map" parameter is an array of the structure named
"oi_actionmap", which contains the following two elements:

uint actionid;
  This is the user-defined, unique action id, which the user
  listens for. Ie. it is up to the user to make a mapping
  between this number and an action. That's easy, as an action
  should be something like '#define ACTION_JUMP 3', etc. etc.
    
char *name;
  The name of the event, which should generate the action. The
  event name is the name of the button (or alike), for example
  "key_space" or "mouse_button_left".
