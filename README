libsinp
------------------------------------------------------------------------

libsinp is short for "library for simple input", and is intended as
an easy-to-use, cross-platform input library handler. The goal is
to provide a SDL-alike interface to input devices such as keyboards,
mice and joysticks while keeping the dependencies for the library
at a bare minimum.

A lot of code has been ripped, abused and otherwise mangled and
mingled from the SDL project (http://www.libsdl.org/), and you
should know that

       Without the EXCELLENT piece of software SDL is
       libsinp would simply never have existed!
       Thank you so much and keep up the good work!
