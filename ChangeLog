 	* Partially added: DirectX (DirectInput) input driver
	* Added: OpenInput manual (work-in-progress)
	* Cleanup: Manually detect doxygen, dot, perl and texi2html
	* Cleanup: Setup build structure for API and manual where
	  manual control of build process was required.
	* Fix: Updated Doxygen pages and README to report correct homepage
	  address
	* Fix: Document whether or not oi_events_poll/wait/pump blocks
	* Fix: Joystick axes are now set properly
	  (patch by Jon Manning, thanks a lot)
	* Addded: Support for joystick axes and buttons in platform tester
	  (also contributed by Jon Manning -- thanks again!)
	* Fix: Include sys/select.h in x11_events.c, so OI compiles on OS X
	  (thanks to Richard Smith for reporting this)
	* Fix: Renamed "win32-config.h" to "config.h" in the nongnu directory
	  and removed unix-signal driver under Win32. This way no files
	  needs to be copied/moved when building using MSVC/Codeblocks.
	* Added: Microsoft Visual Studio 7.0 project files for the library
          and test programs for win32, located in the "nongnu" directory.

          (in the nongnu dir)
	* Fix: Lots of int/char/signedness warnings mismatch detected
          by MSVC and support for older win32 SDK standard
	* Fix: Win32 A-Z and 0-9 now has correct OIK_* value
	  (reported by discipline)
	* Fix: Win32 keytable range check on vkey translation
	  (reported by alphageek)
	* Fix: Don't copy subversion files in nongnu directory
	* Fix: Minor platform-independt test changes
	* Fix: Spelling in README

	  moved to seperate file 'platform.c'
	* Fix: Add executable extension (exeext) to tests programs
	  in configure (fixes win32/mingw test compilation)
	* Fix: missing win32 driver type name fixes
	* Add: Win32 test program (wip)

	* Added: Library open-close-open-close test. It works! (tm)
	* Fix: Enable keyboard repeat generation (remove debug 'return' line)

Version 0.2.1 - 2005-09-16

	* Cleanup: Event structure cleanup
	* Fix/Change: eliminated numerical types in order to coexist with
	  the standard library. The renders the API incompatible!

	  bug (thanks discipline)
	
Version 0.2.0 - 2005-09-15

	* Fix: oi_init() should (normally) not bail if managers fail init
	* Changed: Fully tab-is-four-spaces indented everything!
	* Fix: configure/automake dir/lib/test generation cleanup and
	  win32 link library fix

	* Fix: x11-resize only post event on real resize
	* Fix: Added Win32 calling convention and export keyword to
	  all API functions in openinput.h / openinput_api.h
	* Fix: oi_events_wait() uses nanosleep() instead of usleep under
	  POSIX and Sleep() under win32.
	* Fix: device_windowid() does not depend on "index()"
	* Added: ARCHDET macro for configure to get nice arch name
	  for future use (configure-time autoconfiguration)
	* Added: action_clearreal() function to reset state of analogue
	  actions. This is called during the beginning of oi_events_pump
	* Added: Action manager support for joysticks
	* Fixed: Pointer safety check in oi_mouse_absolute/relative
	* Fixed: Doxygen group/brief/description belong-here issues
	* Changed: Reordered function paramaters: index is always first
	* Added/Change: state manager data is now per-device using the new
	  oi_private[] data structures. This change has been
	  implemented for both keyboard, mouse and joystick managers	  
	* Added: Joystick state manager
	* Fix: renamed Doxyfile to Doxyfile.in and reenable
	  autoconf processing for correct setting of version
	* Fix: key/modifier name typo in foo/foo.c
	* Added: Win32 input driver

	  in version. Input file is 'openinput_h_version.in' which
	  is renamed by configure

	* Added: device->reset() function. Drivers must do a full
	  driver/device-state resync, used for enable/disable device.
	* Added: oi_device_enable() to enable/disable pumping
	* Added: oi_device_info() to get name/desc/provide
	* Added: GNU/Linux joystick driver
